  <h1>Privacy Policy for PixelNote</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: October 22, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>PixelNote ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how PixelNote handles information and permissions while providing a fully offline, privacy-first experience.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or any identifying information.</li>
    <li><strong>No Image Data:</strong> Images you create remain on your device; we never upload or store them.</li>

    <li><strong>No Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not track how you use the app.</li>
    <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> Registration or login is not needed.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Sharing is handled by your device's native functionality.</li>
    <li>PixelNote does not access shared content after it leaves your device.</li>
