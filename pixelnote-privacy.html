  <h1>Privacy Policy for PixelNote</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: October 22, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>PixelNote ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how PixelNote handles information and permissions while providing a fully offline, privacy-first experience.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>PixelNote does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong> All data stays on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No Personal Data: We do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or any identifying information.</li>
    <li>No Image Data: Images you create remain on your device; we never upload or store them.</li>
    <li>No Text Data: Text content you enter is processed locally and never leaves your device.</li>
    <li>No Usage Analytics: We do not track how you use the app.</li>
    <li>No Account Required: Registration or login is not needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <h3>Camera</h3>
  <p>Purpose: To capture or embed images within the app. All images are stored locally; none are shared or transmitted.</p>

  <h3>Storage</h3>
  <p>Purpose: To save and read files necessary for app functionality. All files remain on your device.</p>

  <h3>Internet (Optional)</h3>
  <p>Purpose: Only used to display advertisements via Google AdMob. No personal or image data is transmitted by PixelNote. Ad information is collected solely by Google. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
  <p>PixelNote may display ads via Google AdMob. AdMob may collect information such as device ID, IP address, OS version, and general location. This data is collected by Google, not by PixelNote.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>PixelNote does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is intended for users aged 13 and older.</p>

  <h2>Image Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You choose which apps to share through (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.).</li>
    <li>Sharing is handled by your device's native functionality.</li>
    <li>PixelNote does not access shared content after it leaves your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>All processing happens locally and no personal data is collected, so there is no risk of data breaches from our side.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy occasionally. Updates will appear on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, contact us at: <a href="mailto:darkmintis@gmail.com">darkmintis@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>By using PixelNote, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>

  <div class="summary">
    Summary: PixelNote is a privacy-first offline app. No personal information, images, or text leave your device. The only third-party service is Google AdMob for ads (if enabled), governed by Google’s privacy policy.
